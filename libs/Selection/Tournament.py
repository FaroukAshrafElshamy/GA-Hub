    Tournament Technique:

        In K-Way tournament selection, we select K individuals from the population at random and
        selectthe best out of these to become a parent. The same process is repeated for selecting 
        the next parent.Tournament Selection is also extremely popular in literature as it can even
        work with negative fitness values.
